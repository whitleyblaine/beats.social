# beats.social
A website that allows users to upload rap instrumentals, rate/tag them, then search by category and rating. Beats can be either free or paid. Solves a specific problem faced by most rappers -- finding beats quickly and effectively, instead of typing "[example rapper] type beat" into youtube and listening to each one.
